## How to contribute

### 1. Fork the repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of the repository page to create your own copy.

### 2. Clone your fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

### 3. Set up the development environment

Ensure you have Python and Poetry installed and set up a virtual environment:

```sh
poetry install
poetry shell
```

Additionally, you need to have a Meilisearch instance running. To make things easier, you can use Docker for this:

```sh
docker run --name meilisearch -p 7700:7700 --rm -d getmeili/meilisearch:latest
```

!!! note
    I use to run the container using `--rm` option to automatically remove the container when it stops, but you can ommit this option if you want to reuse the same container.

### 4. Create a new branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```sh
git switch -c {prefix}/{description}  # or git checkout -b {prefix}/{description} if you are using an older version of git
```

!!! warning
    We use Git Flow to manage branches with the default naming convention. Make sure to follow the naming convention for your branch. If you prefer, you can use the [Git Flow extension](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).

| Branch type | Prefix | Example |

| Feature | feature | feature/your-feature-name |
| Bugfix | fix | fix/your-bug-name |
